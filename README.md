# TF-Parametrization -- Bachelorproject
Using three optimization algorithms to dertermine optimal parameters for mRNA foldchange predictions and identification of TF impact.

## Abstract
All known lifeforms are subject to an internal regulation process dictating their decision making. Thereby the information 
centre of the organism, often the DNA, is part of a complex net of kinetic and thermodynamic interactions between biomolecules. 
Many attempts have been and will be made to map this network of relations. Understanding such processes yields targeted actions 
against any pathological behaviour, be it by endogenous or exogenous cells. Such targeted therapies for diseases have proven to 
be successful in treating highly specific cases like cancer. Though the progress is stagnant, especially for critical cancers 
like triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) which provide difficult challenges, recent publications suggest transcription factors 
(TF) as viable targets for personalised medication. Streamlining the quantification of interconnected transcription regulators 
as part of a network, i.e. the transcription contained portion of any gene regulatory network (GRN), has yet to be done. This 
work focuses on a first step of such a process, incorporating optimization algorithms as means to determine TF impact. By letting 
three common optimization algorithms imitate the fold change of a small test network the general approach of the non-linear model 
equation and utilization of optimization algorithms to quantify parameter values for transcription regulatory networks is 
assessed. Simultaneously the subsequent workflow will provide a basis for further investigation of this strategy.
